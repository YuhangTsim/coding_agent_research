# Roo-Code Context Selection and Management Analysis

## Overview

Roo-Code is an AI-powered autonomous coding agent that lives in your editor. It implements a sophisticated context management system that combines file context tracking, sliding window management, and intelligent conversation summarization. The system is designed to maintain context awareness while managing token limits efficiently.

## Context Selection Methodology

### 1. File Context Tracking System

Roo-Code implements a sophisticated file context tracking system:

```typescript
// src/core/context-tracking/FileContextTracker.ts
export class FileContextTracker {
    readonly taskId: string
    private providerRef: WeakRef<ClineProvider>

    // File tracking and watching
    private fileWatchers = new Map<string, vscode.FileSystemWatcher>()
    private recentlyModifiedFiles = new Set<string>()
    private recentlyEditedByRoo = new Set<string>()
    private checkpointPossibleFiles = new Set<string>()

    constructor(provider: ClineProvider, taskId: string) {
        this.providerRef = new WeakRef(provider)
        this.taskId = taskId
    }
}

**Key Features:**
- **File System Watching**: Monitors file changes in real-time
- **Context State Tracking**: Tracks active, stale, and edited files
- **Roo vs User Edit Detection**: Distinguishes between Roo and user edits
- **Task-Based Context**: Maintains context per task session

### 2. Multi-Source Context Recording

Roo-Code tracks context from multiple sources:

```typescript
// src/core/context-tracking/FileContextTrackerTypes.ts
export type RecordSource = "read_tool" | "user_edited" | "roo_edited" | "file_mentioned"

export type FileMetadataEntry = {
    path: string
    record_state: "active" | "stale"
    record_source: RecordSource
    roo_read_date: number | null
    roo_edit_date: number | null
    user_edit_date: number | null
}
}

**Context Sources:**
- **Read Tool**: Files read via Roo's file reading tools
- **User Edited**: Files modified by the user outside of Roo
- **Roo Edited**: Files modified by Roo during tasks
- **File Mentioned**: Files mentioned in conversation or prompts

### 3. Sliding Window Context Management

Roo-Code implements a sliding window approach for context management:

```typescript
// src/core/sliding-window/index.ts
export function truncateConversation(messages: ApiMessage[], fracToRemove: number, taskId: string): ApiMessage[] {
    TelemetryService.instance.captureSlidingWindowTruncation(taskId)
    const truncatedMessages = [messages[0]]
    const rawMessagesToRemove = Math.floor((messages.length - 1) * fracToRemove)
    const messagesToRemove = rawMessagesToRemove - (rawMessagesToRemove % 2)
    const remainingMessages = messages.slice(messagesToRemove + 1)
    truncatedMessages.push(...remainingMessages)

    return truncatedMessages
}
}

**Sliding Window Features:**
- **First Message Preservation**: Always retains the first message
- **Even Pair Removal**: Removes message pairs to maintain conversation flow
- **Configurable Removal**: Adjustable fraction of messages to remove
- **Telemetry Integration**: Tracks truncation events for analysis

## Context Management Methodology

### 1. Intelligent Context Condensation

Roo-Code implements sophisticated context condensation:

```typescript
// src/core/condense/index.ts
const SUMMARY_PROMPT = `\
Your task is to create a detailed summary of the conversation so far, paying close attention to the user's explicit requests and your previous actions.
This summary should be thorough in capturing technical details, code patterns, and architectural decisions that would be essential for continuing with the conversation and supporting any continuing tasks.

Your summary should be structured as follows:
Context: The context to continue the conversation with. If applicable based on the current task, this should include:
  1. Previous Conversation: High level details about what was discussed throughout the entire conversation with the user.
  2. Current Work: Describe in detail what was being worked on prior to this request to summarize the conversation.
  3. Key Technical Concepts: List all important technical concepts, technologies, coding conventions, and frameworks discussed.
  4. Relevant Files and Code: If applicable, enumerate specific files and code sections examined, modified, or created.
  5. Problem Solving: Document problems solved thus far and any ongoing troubleshooting efforts.
  6. Pending Tasks and Next Steps: Outline all pending tasks and next steps with direct quotes from recent conversation.
`

export async function summarizeConversation(
    messages: ApiMessage[],
    apiHandler: ApiHandler,
    systemPrompt: string,
    taskId: string,
    prevContextTokens: number,
    isAutomaticTrigger?: boolean,
    customCondensingPrompt?: string,
    condensingApiHandler?: ApiHandler,
): Promise<SummarizeResponse>
}

**Condensation Features:**
- **Structured Summarization**: Detailed, structured summary format
- **Technical Focus**: Emphasizes technical details and code patterns
- **Task Continuity**: Preserves pending tasks and next steps
- **Quote Preservation**: Maintains direct quotes from recent conversation
- **Custom Prompts**: Supports custom condensing prompts
- **Dual API Support**: Can use different APIs for condensing vs main conversation

### 2. Adaptive Context Thresholds

Roo-Code implements adaptive context thresholds:

```typescript
// src/core/sliding-window/index.ts
export async function truncateConversationIfNeeded({
    messages,
    totalTokens,
    contextWindow,
    maxTokens,
    apiHandler,
    autoCondenseContext,
    autoCondenseContextPercent,
    systemPrompt,
    taskId,
    customCondensingPrompt,
    condensingApiHandler,
    profileThresholds,
    currentProfileId,
}: TruncateOptions): Promise<TruncateResponse>
}

**Threshold Management:**
- **Profile-Based Thresholds**: Different thresholds for different user profiles
- **Global Fallbacks**: Falls back to global settings when profile thresholds are invalid
- **Configurable Percentages**: Adjustable condensation thresholds (5-100%)
- **Token Buffer**: 10% buffer to prevent context overflow
- **Reserved Tokens**: 20% of context window reserved for responses

### 3. Context State Management

**File Context State:**
- **Active Files**: Files currently in context and up-to-date
- **Stale Files**: Files that have been modified outside of Roo
- **Edit Tracking**: Tracks when files were last read or edited by Roo vs user
- **Checkpoint Files**: Files that may need checkpointing

**Context State Flow:**
1. **File Detection**: Detect files mentioned or accessed
2. **State Classification**: Classify files as active or stale
3. **Edit Tracking**: Track edit sources (Roo vs user)
4. **Context Updates**: Update context based on file changes
5. **State Persistence**: Maintain context state across sessions

### 4. Context Optimization Features

**Token Management:**
- **Conservative Estimation**: Uses provider's token counting for accuracy
- **Buffer Management**: Maintains 10% buffer to prevent overflow
- **Reserved Space**: Reserves 20% of context for responses
- **Adaptive Thresholds**: Profile-based condensation thresholds

**Performance Optimizations:**
- **File System Watching**: Efficient file change detection
- **Weak References**: Prevents memory leaks in file tracking
- **Telemetry Integration**: Tracks context management events
- **Async Processing**: Non-blocking context operations
