Research on the context selection and context management methodology in open-sourced coding agents, including Cli tools, and VScode Extentions.

## ToDo

1. IN each repo under `/github_repos`, create a `report.md` for each repos.
2. Under each `report.md`, perform analysis on their methodology of context selection and context management.
   1. How does each project select the right context given a prompt
   2. How does each project manage the context in action after context are selected
   3. List out the methodology and logics
   4. List out the possible limitation
