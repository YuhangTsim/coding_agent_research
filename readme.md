# OS Coding Agent Research

Research on the context selection and context management methodology in open-sourced coding agents, including Cli tools, and VScode Extentions.

## ToDo

1. IN each repo under `./github_repos`, create a `report_<repoName>.md` for each repos under `./report_<AgentName>` (if `./report_<AgentName>` does not exist, create one).
2. Under each `repor_<repoName>.md`, perform analysis on their methodology of context selection and context management.
   1. How does each project select the right context given a prompt
   2. How does each project manage the context in action after context are selected
   3. List out the methodology and logics
   4. List out the possible limitation
